# What is Git LFS

Git LFS (Large File Storage) is a Git tool which replaces large files with pointers in your Git databse. These pointers point to the actual file on a remote server. Using Git LFS avoids your Git repo becoming huge and awkward to handle overtime.

# Using Git LFS

To use git lfs to commit these files, you will need to run `git lfs install` your git user account on your machine. You will only need to do this once.

To add file types for git lfs to handle run:

```
git lfs track "*.xxx"
git add .gitattributes
```

Do this BEFORE commiting any files of this type

# Common Issues

## Encountered a file that should have been a pointer but wasn't

This usually occurs when a user does not have Git LFS installed and has pushed a filewhich Git LFS is tracking to the Git databse.

To fix this, run the following:

```
git lfs migrate import --no-rewrite "PATH TO FILE"
```
