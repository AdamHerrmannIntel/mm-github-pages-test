I am an avid listener of Cal Newport's Deep Life Podcast and I have been implenenting some of his recommendations in my daily life. On his most recent episode (EP. 272 - The Essential Tools), he details 4 essential producivity tools, which after implementing, you should not need to worry about productivity again. I won't list these here, (go listen to the episode), but one of the tools is to detail the system you have in place and follow. Cal explains the rational as being a psycology trick to make sure your brain does not think the system is an experiement or temporary plan, but something set in stone. So below I am sharing what I am following (or at least try to follow).
