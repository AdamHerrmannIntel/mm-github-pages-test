I am an avid listener of [Cal Newport's Deep Life Podcast](https://www.thedeeplife.com/listen/) and I have been implenenting some of his recommendations in my daily life. On his most recent episode [(EP. 272 - The Essential Tools)](https://www.thedeeplife.com/podcasts/episodes/ep-272-the-essential-tools-w-david-epstein/), he details 4 essential producivity tools, which after implementing, you should not need to worry about productivity again. I won't list these here, (go listen to the episode), but one of the tools is to detail the system you have in place and follow. Cal explains the rational as being a psycology trick to make sure your brain does not think the system is an experiement or temporary plan, but something set in stone. So below I am sharing what I am following (or at least try to follow).

# Obligation Status List
I keep a obligation status list detailing the various areas I have commited to, and if the next action in moving this forward is waiting on me, or something/someone else.

# Startup/Shutdown Routine
At the start of the day I review the Obligation Status List, task list, and upcoming meetings to plan my day using [Time Block Planning](https://www.timeblockplanner.com/).

At the end of the day I update the Obligation Status List, move any jotted down tasks to their relevent lists, and generally make sure there are no lose ends.

# Monthly/Weekly Plans
I create a monthly plan on what I want to accomplish and base a weekly plan on that monthly plan.
